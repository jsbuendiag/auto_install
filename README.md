### Description
Very simple bash script used to install some main tools for bug bounty. This should be used on an ubuntu VPS or virutal machine.

I am not an expert in bash, so many things might go wrong and can have a better way to do it.

### Usage
First give the appropiate privileges to the file:

`chmod +x auto_install.sh`

Then just execute the program:

`sudo -u <your sudoer user> -E ./auto_install.sh`
